# Objective
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate time series models to forecast the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases over time, at both the country and WHO region level.
The focus will be on using ARIMA and SARIMAX models to capture trends and seasonal patterns in the data and to compare their performance

# Key Questions
1) Can time series models reliably predict daily or weekly confirmed COVID-19 cases for a given country
2) How do forecasts differ across WHO regions?
3) Which model, ARIMA or SARIMAX, works better for this type of data?

# Scope
1) Explore the data to identify trends, seasonal effects, and other patterns.
2) Build time series models to forecast future confirmed case counts.
3) Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics, such as RMSE and MAPE.
4) Compare the results and discuss which model performs best and why.
5) Visualize the forecasts and explain what they could mean for public health planning.
